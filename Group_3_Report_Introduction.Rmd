## Introduction

people who are diagnosed with diabetes are always advised to control their diet and cut calories for their health. But do people in the US literally follow this guideline? 

We found this question very interesting and worth to study. Thus the substantive question our group is going to answer is: Do people diagnosed with diabetes consume less calories in the US?

Our analysis espect to show a Linear Mixed Model(LMM) analyzing the effect of diabetes diagnosis on consumption of total calories, controling over other related predictors. The LMM result can give us information over the calories intake difference among people with and without diabetes.



## Data  

We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [2015-2016](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015) data, which is publicly available on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.   

The datasets and variables we used for our research question are summarized below:

## Methods  

We fitted a linear mixed model to analyze the effect of diabetes diagnosis on consumption of total calories from both interview days, controlling for demographics, BMI and physical activity, and including a random intercept for each respondent. Below we provide details in each step: 

1. Data merging  

XPT files needed for the analysis were downloaded from the CDC website. Different datasets were merged into one using SEQN (respondent sequence number), and only variables we listed in the above data section were included in the merged data.  

We have a merged dataset for day 1 only, one for day 2 only, and another one with day 1 and day 2 data stacked together.  

2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria  

Respondents with unknown diabetes are excluded from analysis.  

Respondents with confirmed pregnancy (RIDEXPRG) were excluded from our analysis.  

Ages over 89 are considered protected health infomration (PHI). Therefore, NHANES data top-coded age variable at 80 years old, which means respondents aged 80 or more were all recorded as 80 in NHANES data. Therefore, we only include respondents aged 12 to 79 in our analysis.  

3. Variable recoding  

We created a new binary *diabetes* variable, where respondents with diabetes diagnosis or borderline diagnosis are both considered positive (1)  in this new variable, and respondents with confirmed non-diabetes diagnosis are considered negative (0).  

We recoded the two-level (1 vs 2) gender variable to a new *male* variable, where 1 indicates male, and 0 indicates female.  

We added a *day* variable to indicate the dietary interview day.  

4. Missing pattern checks
Missingness of each variable was checked in our analysis. Variable with large proportion of missing was furthre excluded from our analysis. Observations with missing in any of the variables we are going to use were deleted from the working dataset.  

5. Normality examination  

We checked the normality of our response variable - total energy (kcal), by interview day, and discussed the necessity of transformation.  

6. Multicollinearity inspection  

The correlation matrix of predictors were examined. 

We then fitted a simple linear regression model using day 1 data only, and examined the variance inflation factor (VIF) to assess collinearity.  

Predictors were the selected based on the multicollinearity inspection results.

7. Model fitting  

We used both days' data to then fit a linear mixed model, including a random intercept for each respondent. 

**To do:** obtain marginal effects  


The data preparation, model checking and model fitting were performed parallel in R, SAS, and Python.

# Merge all of the relevant variables

              "vig_work","mod_work","sed_act","DR1","DR2","bmi")
```

`%notin%` = Negate(`%in%`)

# exclude data without diabetes diagnosis
c = c(1,2,3)
dm = dm[-which(dm$DIQ010 %notin% c), ]

# exclude pregnant participants
dm = dm[-which(dm$pregnancy==1), ]

# create a new variable representing diabetes
  # 1 - diabetes or borderline
  # 0 - non-diabetes
dm$diabetes = ifelse(dm$DIQ010==2, 0, 1)

# create a new variable representing male
  # 1 - male
  # 0 - female
dm$male = ifelse(dm$gender==1, 1, 0)

# pivot the data into "long" format
# and create a variable representing dietary interview day (1/2)
dm = dm %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("DR"),
    names_to = "day",
    names_prefix = "DR",
    values_to = "kcal",
    values_drop_na = FALSE
    )%>%
  arrange(SEQN, day)

# check for missing values for each variable
colSums(is.na(dm))
```

```
`vig_work` and `mod_work` have much more missing values than other variables, so it is
reasonable to remove them from the data frame.  
`pregnancy` can also be removed since we only need this variable to filter out pregnant
individuals.  
`DIQ010` and `gender` are now redundant due to the new variables.  

Note that `age` is top-coded at 80, which means participants aged 80 or older were all
recorded as age 80. To avoid inaccurate data, we decided to set an age bound from 12 to 79.
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
dm = dm %>%
  select(-pregnancy, -vig_work, -mod_work, -DIQ010, -gender) %>%
  filter(age>=12 & age<=79)
dm$day = as.numeric(dm$day)
# remove rows with missing value
dm_final = dm[complete.cases(dm),]
dr1_final = dm_final[dm_final$day==1,]
dr2_final = dm_final[dm_final$day==2,]
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# check if the response variable - kcal is normally distributed
# day1
hist(dm_final[dm_final$day==1, ]$kcal, main = "Day 1")
# day2
hist(dm_final[dm_final$day==2, ]$kcal, main = "Day 2")
```

```
`kcal` seems to be approximately normal with a longer right tail for both day1 and day2.
In this case, no transformation would be needed.
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# fit a linear regression model
model = dm_final %>% lm(formula = kcal ~ age + sed_act + bmi + diabetes + male)
# check collinearity
summary(model)
