## Introduction

People who are diagnosed with diabetes are generally advised to control their diet and cut calories for their health (**To do**: insert a reference here). Do people in the US literally follow this guideline? 

We found this question very interesting and worth to study. Thus the substantive question our group is going to answer is: Do people diagnosed with diabetes consume less calories in the US?

Our analysis plan is to use a Linear Mixed Model(LMM) analyzing the effect of diabetes diagnosis on consumption of total calories, controling over other related predictors. The LMM result can give us information over the calories intake difference among people with and without diabetes.



## Data  

We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [2015-2016](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015) data, which is publicly available on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.   

The datasets and variables we used for our research question are summarized below:  

Dataset | Dataset Description | Variable name | Variable Description | Variable type  
------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------| -------------
Every dataset listed below | | SEQN | Respondent<br> sequence number | Numeric  
[**Demographics data**](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015) | | |

DR1TOT_I | Total Nutrient Intakes<br> First Day | DR1TKCAL | Energy (kcal) | Numeric
DR2TOT_I | Total Nutrient Intakes<br> Second Day |DR2TKCAL | Energy (kcal) | Numeric

BMI_I | Body Measurement | BMXBMI | Body Mass Index (kg/m$^2$) | Numeric
[**Questionnaire data**](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2015) | | |

PAQ_I | Physical Activity | PAD615 | Minutes vigorous-intensity work | Numeric
PAD_I | Physical Activity | PAD630 | Minutes moderate-intensity work | Numeric
PAD_I | Physical Activity | PAD680 | Minutes sedentary activity | Numeric



## Methods  

We fitted a linear mixed model to analyze the effect of diabetes diagnosis on consumption of total calories from both interview days, controlling for demographics, BMI and physical activity, and including a random intercept for each respondent. Below we provide details in each step: 

1. Data merging  

XPT files needed for the analysis were downloaded from the CDC website. Different datasets were merged into one using SEQN (respondent sequence number), and only variables we listed in the above data section were included in the merged data.  

We have a merged dataset for day 1 only, one for day 2 only, and another one with day 1 and day 2 data stacked together.  

2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria  

Respondents with unknown diabetes are excluded from analysis.  

Respondents with confirmed pregnancy (RIDEXPRG) were excluded from our analysis.  

Ages over 89 are considered protected health infomration (PHI). Therefore, NHANES data top-coded age variable at 80 years old, which means respondents aged 80 or more were all recorded as 80 in NHANES data. Therefore, we only include adolescent and adult respondents aged 12 to 79 in our analysis.  

3. Variable recoding  

We created a new binary *diabetes* variable, where respondents with diabetes diagnosis or borderline diagnosis are both considered positive (1)  in this new variable, and respondents with confirmed non-diabetes diagnosis are considered negative (0).  

We recoded the two-level (1 vs 2) gender variable to a new *male* variable, where 1 indicates male, and 0 indicates female.  

We added a *day* variable to indicate the dietary interview day.  

4. Missing pattern checks
Missingness of each variable was checked in our analysis. Variable with large proportion of missing was furthre excluded from our analysis. Observations with missing in any of the variables we are going to use were deleted from the working dataset.  

5. Normality examination  

We checked the normality of our response variable - total energy (kcal), by interview day, and discussed the necessity of transformation.  

6. Multicollinearity inspection  

The correlation matrix of predictors were examined. 

We then fitted a simple linear regression model using day 1 data only, and examined the variance inflation factor (VIF) to assess collinearity.  

Predictors were the selected based on the multicollinearity inspection results.

7. Model fitting  

We used both days' data to then fit a linear mixed model, including a random intercept for each respondent. 

**To do:** obtain marginal effects  


The data preparation, model checking and model fitting were performed parallel in R, SAS, and Python.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Merge all of the relevant variables

names(dm) = c("SEQN","age","gender","pregnancy","DIQ010",
              "vig_work","mod_work","sed_act","DR1","DR2","bmi")
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# create a "not in" operator
`%notin%` = Negate(`%in%`)

# exclude data without diabetes diagnosis
c = c(1,2,3)
dm = dm[-which(dm$DIQ010 %notin% c), ]

# exclude pregnant participants
dm = dm[-which(dm$pregnancy==1), ]

# create a new variable representing diabetes
  # 1 - diabetes or borderline
  # 0 - non-diabetes
dm$diabetes = ifelse(dm$DIQ010==2, 0, 1)

# create a new variable representing male
  # 1 - male
  # 0 - female
dm$male = ifelse(dm$gender==1, 1, 0)

# pivot the data into "long" format
# and create a variable representing dietary interview day (1/2)
dm = dm %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("DR"),
    names_to = "day",
    names_prefix = "DR",
    values_to = "kcal",
    values_drop_na = FALSE
    )%>%
  arrange(SEQN, day)

# check for missing values for each variable
colSums(is.na(dm))
```

```
`vig_work` and `mod_work` have much more missing values than other variables, so it is
reasonable to remove them from the data frame.  
`pregnancy` can also be removed since we only need this variable to filter out pregnant
individuals.  
`DIQ010` and `gender` are now redundant due to the new variables.  

Note that `age` is top-coded at 80, which means participants aged 80 or older were all
recorded as age 80. To avoid inaccurate data, we decided to set an age bound from 12 to 79.
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
dm = dm %>%
  select(-pregnancy, -vig_work, -mod_work, -DIQ010, -gender) %>%
  filter(age>=12 & age<=79)
dm$day = as.numeric(dm$day)
# remove rows with missing value
dm_final = dm[complete.cases(dm),]
dr1_final = dm_final[dm_final$day==1,]
dr2_final = dm_final[dm_final$day==2,]
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# check if the response variable - kcal is normally distributed
# day1
ggplot(dr1_final, aes(x = kcal)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), 
                 bins = 100, 
                 fill = "blue", 
                 alpha = 0.8) + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = mean(dr1_final$kcal), 
                            sd = sd(dr1_final$kcal))) + 
  theme_bw()
# day2
ggplot(dr2_final, aes(x = kcal)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), 
                 bins = 100, 
                 fill = "blue", 
                 alpha = 0.8) + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                args = list(mean = mean(dr2_final$kcal), 
                            sd = sd(dr2_final$kcal))) + 
  theme_bw()
```

```
`kcal` seems to be approximately normal with a longer right tail for both day1 and day2.
In this case, no transformation would be needed.
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# fit a linear regression model
model = dr1_final %>% 
  lm(formula = kcal ~ age + sed_act + bmi + factor(diabetes) + factor(male))
# check collinearity
summary(model)
faraway::vif(model)
corrplot(cor(dm_final))
corrplot(cor(dr1_final))
```

```
No collinearity found.
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# fit a linear mixed model
model2 = dm_final %>% 
  lmer(formula = kcal ~ age + sed_act + bmi + factor(diabetes) + factor(male) + (1|SEQN))
summary(model2)

Above is the correlation matrix for the five predictors we picked. We want to check if any of the variables included have a high correlation - about 0.8 or higher - with any other variable. Upon review of this correlation matrix, there does not appear to be any pair of variable with a particular high correlation.

</div>

Next, we fit an ordinary linear regression model. In the above results, we check Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or Tolerance (1/VIF) for potential multicollinearity. VIF greater than 10 or Tolerance less than 0.1 should be warned if exists. Obviously, there is no treat of multicollinearity indicated in our model. 

We further look at the collinearity diagnostics (eigenvalues and condition numbers). If one or more of the eigenvalues are small (close to zero) and the corresponding condition number being large, then we have an indication of multicollinearity. As we can see from the above results, none of our eigenvalues and condition index associations match this description. 

**Conclusion**: No multicollinearity issue found in our model.

## Results  

The linear regression model gave a decent fit to the data, but the percentage that this model was able to explain was rather low. The linear mixed model (LMM), on the other hand, generated in SAS and R, seems to be a better choice for regression analysis. Our LMM showed that the predictor variables of interest are all statistically significant, suggesting that all of these predictors are very likely to have an effect on the response variable. However, before drawing any conclusion, we still need to perform analysis on marginal effects, and we need to take a closer look at our Python section and figure out how to match it with the models in R and SAS. If the final steps agree with our previous analysis, then we can conclude that people diagnosed with diabetes consume less calories in the US.
