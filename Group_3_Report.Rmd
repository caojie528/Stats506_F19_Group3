## Introduction

**To do**:  

What your question is  

Why it is interesting  

What your analysis will show  


## Data  

We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [2015-2016](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015) data, which is publicly available on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.   

The datasets and variables we used for our research question are summarized below:  

Dataset | Dataset Description | Variable name | Variable Description | Variable type  
------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------| -------------
Every dataset listed below | | SEQN | Respondent<br> sequence number | Numeric  
[**Demographics data**](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015) | | | 
DEMO_I | Demographics | RIDAGEYR | Age in years at screening | Numeric 
DEMO_I | Demographics | RIAGENDR | Gender | Numeric 
DEMO_I | Demographics | RIDEXPRG | Pregnancy status at exam | Numeric 
[**Dietary data**](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Dietary&CycleBeginYear=2015) | | |
DR1TOT_I | Total Nutrient Intakes<br> First Day | DR1TKCAL | Energy (kcal) | Numeric
DR2TOT_I | Total Nutrient Intakes<br> Second Day |DR2TKCAL | Energy (kcal) | Numeric
[**Examination data**](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Examination&CycleBeginYear=2015) | | |
BMI_I | Body Measurement | BMXBMI | Body Mass Index (kg/m$^2$) | Numeric
[**Questionnaire data**](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2015) | | |
DIQ_I | Diabetes | DIQ010 | Doctor told you have diabetes | Numeric
PAQ_I | Physical Activity | PAD615 | Minutes vigorous-intensity work | Numeric
PAD_I | Physical Activity | PAD630 | Minutes moderate-intensity work | Numeric
PAD_I | Physical Activity | PAD680 | Minutes sedentary activity | Numeric



## Methods  

We fitted a linear mixed model to analyze the effect of diabetes diagnosis on consumption of total calories from both interview days, controlling for demographics, BMI and physical activity, and including a random intercept for each respondent. Below we provide details in each step: 

1. Data merging  

XPT files needed for the analysis were downloaded from the CDC website. Different datasets were merged into one using SEQN (respondent sequence number), and only variables we listed in the above data section were included in the merged data.  

We have a merged dataset for day 1 only, one for day 2 only, and another one with day 1 and day 2 data stacked together.  

2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria  

Respondents with unknown diabetes are excluded from analysis.  

Respondents with confirmed pregnancy (RIDEXPRG) were excluded from our analysis.  

Ages over 89 are considered protected health infomration (PHI). Therefore, NHANES data top-coded age variable at 80 years old, which means respondents aged 80 or more were all recorded as 80 in NHANES data. Therefore, we only include respondents aged 12 to 79 in our analysis.  

3. Variable recoding  

We created a new binary *diabetes* variable, where respondents with diabetes diagnosis or borderline diagnosis are both considered positive (1)  in this new variable, and respondents with confirmed non-diabetes diagnosis are considered negative (0).  

We recoded the two-level (1 vs 2) gender variable to a new *male* variable, where 1 indicates male, and 0 indicates female.  

We added a *day* variable to indicate the dietary interview day.  

4. Missing pattern checks
Missingness of each variable was checked in our analysis. Variable with large proportion of missing was furthre excluded from our analysis. Observations with missing in any of the variables we are going to use were deleted from the working dataset.  

5. Normality examination  

We checked the normality of our response variable - total energy (kcal), by interview day, and discussed the necessity of transformation.  

6. Multicollinearity inspection  

The correlation matrix of predictors were examined. 

We then fitted a simple linear regression model using day 1 data only, and examined the variance inflation factor (VIF) to assess collinearity.  

Predictors were the selected based on the multicollinearity inspection results.

7. Model fitting  

We used both days' data to then fit a linear mixed model, including a random intercept for each respondent. 

**To do:** obtain marginal effects  


The data preparation, model checking and model fitting were performed parallel in R, SAS, and Python.
